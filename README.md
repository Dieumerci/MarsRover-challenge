# next45-MarsRover-challenge
The code and programs, that are contained within the folder are solution's to the Mars Rover coding challenge.

## DESIGN AND ASSUMPTIONS
After doing some research, I came to a conclusion that the best approach to solve the Mars rover coding challenge is to implement the TDD methodology. The TDD methodology follows a RED, GREEN and REFACTOR approach the TDD approach is explained in detail below:
1. The first approach is to write all the test code.
1. After the test code is written, I ran the code which lead to:
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
In conclusion I'd love the opportunity to discuss both the Design Pattern implementations and TDD approach further with your developers, as I'm sure there's a lot I can learn and improve in these aspects
## DEVELOPMENT ENVIROMENT
The following tools were used to developed the application:
* IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2.3
* Third Party Tools:
  * hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
  * junit-4.12.jar
* Build Tools:
  * JUnit 4.1.2
  * Java version 1.8.0_111
## INSTALLATION AND TESTING
The main class(Main.java) is reside inside next45\src\RoverMain.java. We need to run this file to run the application.
To get up and running with the code:
* Import and setup the project in your chosen IDE
* Run the Gradle 'clean', this will run all the tests in Gradle and build you a .jar
* Run the RoverMain class, this will test the input and output in the command line

## TEST
Unit Test cases:
Unit test cases are available under next45\tests\RoverTest.java.
