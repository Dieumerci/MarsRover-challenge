# next45-MarsRover-challenge
The code and programs, that are contained within the folder are solution's to the Mars Rover coding challenge.

## INSTALLATION AND TESTING
After doing some research, I came to a conclusion that the best approach to solve the Mars rover coding challenge is to implement the TDD methodology. The TDD methodology follows a RED, GREEN and REFACTOR approach the TDD approach is explained in detail below:
1. The first approach is to write all the test code.
1. After the test code is written, I ran the code which lead to:
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b


In conclusion I'd love the opportunity to discuss both the Design Pattern implementations and TDD approach further with your developers, as I'm sure there's a lot I can learn and improve in these aspects
